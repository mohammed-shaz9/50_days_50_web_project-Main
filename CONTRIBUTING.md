## Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to our project! To ensure smooth collaboration and effective contribution management, please adhere to the following guidelines:

### Issue Creation

1. **Limit on Issues:**
   - Each contributor is allowed to create a maximum of **4 issues per day**. This helps us manage and address issues efficiently.

### Contribution Levels

2. **Basic Contributions:**
   - This project is primarily focused on documentation. Most of the setup has been completed, so contributors will generally need to work on basic code tasks, such as writing tests.
   - For these tasks, issues will be assigned the **Easy** label.

3. **Acknowledging Hard Work:**
   - If a contributor puts in significant effort on a task, the issue will be upgraded to **Medium**. This is our way of recognizing and appreciating extra effort.

4. **Feature Additions and Component Work:**
   - Contributors working on new features or components using JSX/TSX will be assigned a level based on the complexity and quality of their work.
   - The more complex and valuable the contribution, the higher the level assigned.

### Level Definitions

- **Easy:**
  - Tasks are straightforward, such as fixing minor bugs, writing tests, or making simple documentation updates.
- **Medium:**
  - Tasks require more effort, such as addressing complex bugs, improving existing features, or making substantial documentation improvements.
- **Hard:**
  - Tasks are highly complex and involve significant new feature development, major refactoring, or extensive contributions to the projectâ€™s core components.

We look forward to your contributions and appreciate your effort in helping us improve the project!
